            As much as we love CSS, there are times in which we can’t be
            bothered to design the complete look and feel of our site. We just
            want to churn out, but in our rush, we often neglect our styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a previous post, I talked about Bulma and how easy it makes
            developing a good looking app. This time I want to tell you about
            the framework that started it all.
